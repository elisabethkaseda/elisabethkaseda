### Hi, I'm Elisabeth! (she/her)

I'm currently back at school re-learning about coding and design after a pretty long break. (Still) attempting to get the hang of this GitHub thing! (I'm mostly using it to display the sites I'm working on, but I'm sure as I get into more actual programming, I will want to get better at all of GitHub-ing.)
